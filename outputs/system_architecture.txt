Below is a high‑level system architecture designed to meet the functional and non‑functional requirements for the 2D Newtonian N‑body simulation. This design leverages Python’s rich ecosystem (including pygame, JSON, logging, and optionally numpy) and clearly separates concerns into modular components for better maintainability, extensibility, and performance.

──────────────────────────────
1. Architectural Layers & Components

A. Presentation & Interaction Layer (Visualization/UI Module)
 • Technology: pygame, Python standard libraries (e.g., time, threading for concurrency if needed)
 • Responsibilities:
  – Render simulation state (bodies as circles/icons) and on-screen data output (GUI panel, log area)
  – Process user input (play, pause, reset, simulation speed adjustments, “Add Body” events)
  – Maintain a decoupled event loop to ensure smooth, real‑time rendering at a target frame rate (60 FPS)
 • Key Components:
  – Display Manager: Handles window creation, FPS regulation, and sprite updates.
  – Input Handler: Captures keyboard/mouse events and triggers simulation state changes.
  – UI Controls: On-screen buttons/sliders that adjust runtime parameters (e.g., dt, zoom, simulation speed).

B. Simulation Management Layer (Simulation Manager)
 • Technology: Pure Python (application logic)
 • Responsibilities:
  – Orchestrate simulation life cycle (initialization, running, pausing, resetting)
  – Coordinate periodic invocations of the physics update, visualization refresh, and logging routines
  – Synchronize the simulation “ticks” (time step updates) with GUI rendering.
 • Key Components:
  – Simulation Loop: A central loop that invokes physics integration and triggers UI refresh.
  – State Manager: Maintains simulation variables such as current simulation time, list of bodies, and simulation state (running/paused).

C. Physics & Integration Layer (Physics Engine Module)
 • Technology: Python with potential use of numpy for vectorized numeric operations, optionally Cython for optimization
 • Responsibilities:
  – Compute gravitational forces among all body pairs using Newton’s law:
   Force = (G * m1 * m2) / (r²) considering vector directions.
  – Update positions and velocities using a configurable numerical integration method:
   • Euler, Verlet, or Runge–Kutta.
  – Manage time step (dt) updates so that integration remains synchronized with simulation clock.
  – Detect and handle numerical instabilities (e.g., overlapping bodies or nearly zero separation).
 • Key Components:
  – Body Model: Class defining properties for each celestial body (mass, position vector, velocity vector, etc.).
  – Force Calculator: Methods to compute pairwise interactions.
  – Integrators: Encapsulated methods/classes for each numerical integration technique; strategy pattern can be used to switch methods based on configuration.
  – Optimizer (Optional): For performance, spatial partitioning (quad-trees) or vectorized numpy routines to reduce superfluous calculations.

D. Configuration & Logging Layer
 • Technology: Python’s json module for configuration, Python logging module for logging and output
 • Responsibilities:
  – Load and validate external configuration files (JSON or XML) that detail simulation parameters (e.g., dt, gravitational constant, integration settings, initial body states)
  – Provide default configuration fallback and error management for missing/malformed configurations
  – Route simulation logs and simulation step outputs to:
   • Console, log files, and/or on-screen display panels
  – Ensure logs include timestamps and utilize a standard, easily parseable format for later analysis.
 • Key Components:
  – Config Manager: Reads and validates configuration files; exposes parsed parameters to other modules.
  – Logger: Sets up and manages logging handlers (file, console, GUI overlay) using Python’s logging module.
  – Data Formatter: Formats simulation output data with timestamps per time step.

2. Component Interaction Flow

When the simulation starts:
 1. The Bootstrapping Module initializes the Config Manager to load simulation parameters from the JSON configuration file.  
 2. The Logger is instantiated and configured according to the provided output modes.  
 3. The Simulation Manager creates the initial state by instantiating physics bodies using parameters from the configuration.  
 4. The Physics Engine is configured with the chosen integration method (Euler, Verlet, or Runge–Kutta) and the gravitational constant (G).  
 5. The Visualization/UI Module launches the pygame window and sets up UI controls.
 6. The Simulation Loop starts:
  a. At each time step, the Physics Engine computes gravitational forces, applies the integrator to update bodies’ positions/velocities, and handles any edge-case adjustments.
  b. Simulation state data (positions, velocities, forces) is output through the Logger.
  c. The Visualization/UI Module redraws the frame with updated positions and listens for user input.
  d. The Simulation Manager synchronizes simulation ticks and GUI rendering ensuring decoupled performance.
 7. Event handlers allow users to pause, reset, adjust dt, or add/remove bodies dynamically.
 8. Performance is profiled (using cProfile or timeit) to ensure the simulation meets FPS and responsiveness targets.

4. Design Considerations & Future Extensibility

• Layered Architecture with clear separation between UI, simulation management, physics calculations, and configuration/logging simplifies unit testing and debugging.  
• The Physics Engine is built using a strategy pattern, allowing easy switching between integration methods as well as future addition of new force models or collision detection.  
• The simulation speed and GUI refresh rates are decoupled; simulation ticks (physics updates) and drawing frames can run at different frequencies ensuring both accurate physics and responsive visuals.  
• Error handling is embedded in each module (e.g., configuration validation, numerical stability checks) to prevent a single point of failure and to improve overall system robustness.  
• Modular design using clearly defined interfaces between components (e.g., Simulation Manager calls Physics Engine APIs, UI sends commands to Simulation Manager) ensures ease of maintenance and adaptability for future enhancements.
